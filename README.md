HuniePop Bedroom Mod
--------------------
This mod changes the bedroom game to be easier or harder depending on the chosen difficulty settings. Easy mode will slow down the affection drain to be more manageable, as well as remove Sentiment tokens to make matching all others much more likely. Conversely, Hard mode will increase the drain rate, as well as add two more types of tokens: Joy and Broken Hearts. Normal mode also has a unique change done to it, but it is neither harder nor easier than the base game... in a sense.

Changing the difficulty partway during the puzzle will update the drain rate, but not the token layout, so this can be used to customize your experience to your liking.
